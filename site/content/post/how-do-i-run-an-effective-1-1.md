# Why are we here?

*"Morning, Steve".*

*"Morning, Sarah", Steve yawned in response. He hated early starts, especially when the coffee machine was being slow. The rest of the office was just coming to life as people filed in, exchanging excited morning greetings. Steve was far from excited. He hated Tuesdays. This was the one day a week he had to be in the office this early, all because -*

*"We still on for our 1:1?" Sarah chimed.*

*"Yep. Still on."* 

*Sarah offered a smile. "Great. See you in a bit. Oh, I've got a standup that tends to overrun so I might be a few minutes late." And with that she was off, leaving a bleary eyed Steve to his morning coffee.*

As managers and leaders in our organisations, 1-on-1 meetings are the most important events in our calendar - but all too often they can feel boring, uninspired, a waste of time and energy.

The problem with this is that it belies the importance of these precious face-to-face encounters. They offer a chance for line managers to demonstrate just how valued the team member is by providing opportunities for meaningful conversation, goal setting, coaching, mentoring and strategic alignment - all things that (if your organisation has one) probably align well to your progression framework.

So how do we improve things?

# 1. Commit to a time and place

The first step is to recognise that these are the **most important** meetings in your diary. Schedule a fixed time and location that works for you both. If you're working in a physical office - book out the same meeting room to avoid confusion and help the habit form. 

Do not cancel.

If, for whatever reason, the scheduled meeting can't go ahead - try and fit it in the diary as soon as possible (ideally, in the same week).

The cadence of these meetings will differ from person to person, organisation to organisation - but as a general rule, if gaps between meetings are longer than 2 weeks, try and schedule a quick "coffee break" catchup between formal 1:1 meetings.

Thinking back on the (not entirely fictional!) scene at the start - Sarah, the manager, has done some things well. She's scheduled a recurring meeting in a fixed location - however it's at a time and place that clearly doesn't suit Steve. She can improve this by asking: "Does the time and place of these meetings work for you?" and listening to Steve's feedback.

# 2. Agree a loose shared agenda

This can be as simple as a bullet point list of topics you'd both like to cover. Here's an example from an old notebook of mine:

* Discuss feelings on the latest tribe changes - AM
* Review presentation feedback - AM
* KYC spike findings

(AM denotes an entry made by me, the final point was added by the direct report)

By having a loose shared agenda we can provide as much structure as is needed to keep things on topic, whilst still allowing for meaningful organic conversation to take place.

# 3. Listen more than you talk

If you've listened to a leadership podcast or read a book on the subject, you've doubtless heard a version of this.

> Advice is overrated. I can tell you something, and it’s got a limited chance of making its way into your brain’s hippocampus, the region that encodes memory. If I can ask you a question and you generate the answer yourself, the odds increase substantially.

*Michael Bungay Stanier - The Coaching Habit*

I recall a conversation I had with a previous colleague who I was managing. It went something like this:

Colleague: "I'm really struggling to get through this work. I've got meetings clogging my diary and I can't find time to do anything"

Me: "That sounds like a horrible position to be in. I've actually got some strategies to help with time management - let me talk you through some of them..."

I felt rather proud of myself for giving my colleague the answer to their problems. That lasted until the next 1:1:

Colleague: "I'm still struggling with time management. I can't focus on one task long enough to get it finished."

This time, I took a different approach.

Me: "What's been on your mind?"

My colleague went on to describe how their partner had recently had a health scare and that they now had to take time out of the day to deal with their toddler running around the house, how this was taking a mental toll on them, trying to balance work with the need to look after the family. It went on for about fifteen minutes. At the end of it, my colleague let out a long sigh: "Wow. I didn't mean to dump all that on you, but it's good to get it off my chest."

They didn't need time management strategies from me. 

They needed time to be with their family. 

# 4. Ask open ended questions

One of my favorite strategies for opening up a conversation is to simply ask open ended questions. From experience, here are some of the best:

* What's on your mind?
* What's your favourite/least favourite part of the day? 
* What do you look forward to?
* How has your week been?
* Last time we spoke you mentioned X - how is that going?
* Do you have any feedback (for me, for a project, for someone else, etc)
* What kind of challenges are you facing?
* If you were in my position, what would you change?
* What's the most important thing to you right now?

# 5. Protect yourself

So, you've implemented some of these tactics and your 1:1s are going better than ever, everything's solved, right? The thing is, as these conversations improve and your colleagues feel comfortable bringing issues to the table - you might start feeling less like a manager and more like a therapist. 

I felt this quite keenly during the COVID-19 lockdown. 

Managing a team of software developers who were comfortable bringing personal issues to the discussion was tough. I thought I was helping by lending a compassionate ear, but it was taking it's toll on me too. 

Set boundaries, each person will have different ones, but the lesson I've learned since then is that whilst I'm happy for colleagues to discuss personal issues - I'm not a substitute for a licenced therapist.

Don't carry everything on your shoulders. Find trusted friends or colleagues who you can talk to. Protect your own mental health.
