# Background

After graduating with a degree in computer games development, Andrew began working as a software developer within the Cardiff area, working for multiple early stage startups and SMEs on projects in industries such as retail and hotels, travel, automotive and finance.

A passion for coaching naturally led towards sports where Andrew spent multiple seasons coaching for senior and university American football teams.

# Management Style

Andrew believes that for a team to be in the best possible position to succeed, there are three pillars that need to be addressed. People, Delivery and Technology.

## People

In a successful team, the individuals are both able and motivated to do their best work. They are able to pursue personal and professional development goals that excite and challenge them.

## Delivery

A high performing team is able to deliver value to its stakeholders at a manageable pace. Through continuous evaluation and improvement, the team has the confidence to estimate against and plan for upcoming workload. 

## Technology

The team is capable of designing and implementing software components that are fit for purpose using the best available practices and tools. The software that the team is responsible for meets its SLOs, and operational risks are appropriately managed.
